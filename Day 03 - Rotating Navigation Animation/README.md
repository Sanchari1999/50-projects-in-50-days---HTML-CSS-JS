- Creating a simple article, any website or blog. 
- On clicking the navigation icon on the top-left corner of the screen, the entire website is rotated. 
- The navigation items from the side and the icons also changes. 
- There are two icons: open and close. The icons are so positioned that when clicked, the circle rotated and shows the close button. 
- Mostly used CSS to style the different elements. 
- When the show nav class is present, the only JavaScript really used is to add or move the class when the button is clicked.
